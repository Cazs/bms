[More information](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms.md).

Note that on Linux, some users might experience a GPU bug where the select options rendered as a black box, see [issue #128 of Manta](https://github.com/hql287/Manta/pull/128) and [issue #4322 of Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4322). This can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration like so:

# ```sh
# manta --disable-hardware-acceleration
# ```

> Remember that doing this might lead to some degradation of the app's performance. This is why "the fix" is not included by default.

### FAQ

* **Is this app built with Electron?**

Yes, it's built on top of [Electron](#). Please see the [Technologies](#technologies) section for more info.

* **What boilerplate did you use**

https://github.com/hql287/Manta

* **What CSS/UI Framework did you use?**

I wrote all the CSS myself. I only use Bootstrap for prototyping at first. But I gradually encapsulate most of the style to the component with the help of [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/). There is some places still use Bootstrap mostly for layout purpose but I'll get rid of it eventually.

* **Where did you get the icons?**

[ionicons](http://ionicons.com/). They're great!
